*In this document, we share insights discussed in the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative’s Essential Open Source Software program community call held on July 24, 2025\.*  

This resource is intended to be a conversation-starter for open source software project leaders, their collaborators, staff, and community. 

*The topics contained in the first version of this document reflect only what we discussed on the CZI EOSS community call. We encourage suggestions and contributions to expand the scope of scaling strategies that open source project leaders should consider when managing a project, as well as resources that would be helpful to leaders and their projects.*

### Key Signals It's Time to Reassess Governance:

#### Decision-Making Bottlenecks

* One person is making too-many decisions  
* Decisions feel misaligned with project mission  
* Lack of clear decision-making processes

#### Community Health Indicators

* Difficulty onboarding new members  
* Declining community participation  
* People showing up to "win" rather than collaborate  
* Absence of diverse perspectives

#### Operational Red Flags

* Project falls apart when key people are unavailable  
* Lack of transparent communication  
* No clear succession planning  
* Emerging "fiefdoms" within the project

## Developing a Healthy Governance Approach

---

### Principles for Effective Governance:

#### Mission-Centered

* Always return to the project's core mission  
* Governance should serve the project's goals  
* Transparency is better than specific structural details

#### Inclusive Participation

* Actively solicit underrepresented voices  
* Create multiple entry points for contribution  
* Value non-code contributions  
* Be open by default

### Practical Strategies:

#### Proactive Review Processes

* Talk about governance early and often in project development  
* Schedule regular governance check-ins  
* Use external moderators when possible  
* Conduct periodic community exercises to realign on values

#### Succession and Sustainability

* Implement shadowing/mentorship programs  
* Continuously train potential future leaders, maintainers, and core team members  
* Create systems that outlast individual contributors

#### Community Engagement

* Establish clear communication channels  
* Provide opportunities for constructive feedback  
* Create smaller working groups  
* Normalize discussing governance openly

## Recommended Implementation Steps

---

1. Document current processes  
2. Identify potential governance challenges  
3. Create transparent decision-making frameworks  
4. Build in flexibility for future evolution  
5. Prioritize community well-being

### Warning: Common Pitfalls

* Resisting change  
* Centralizing too much power  
* Ignoring community feedback  
* Treating governance as a static concept

**Remember:** Governance is a journey, not a destination. Stay adaptable, mission-focused, and community-oriented.
